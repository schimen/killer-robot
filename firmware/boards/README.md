# Rupert PCB zephyr configuration

This folder contains configuration describing the hardware running on Rupert. It describes the PCB and the expected connections to it. This board should be used when building and flashing code to Rupert.

An ESP32 microcontroller is the brain of the Rupert PCB and this folder therefore mostly uses the default ESP32 configuration for Zephyr.

See [the robot pcb folder](../../robot-pcb/) for details about the pcb.
