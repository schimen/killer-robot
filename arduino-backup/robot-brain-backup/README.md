# Arduino backup Rupert brain
This is an Arduino backup program for the Rupert brain. Please use [main robot brain](../../robot-brain/) if possible.

This brain shall receive our evil commands and execute them.
We use [this library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/SimpleTimer/) for timers for non blocking delay. This library is included in repo so there is no need to install it.
