# Brain of our killer robot

This brain shall receive our evil commands and execute them.
We use [this library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/SimpleTimer/) for timers for non blocking delay. This library is included in repo so there is no need to install it.
We also use [this library](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/) for the 433MHz radio, so be sure to install it.
