# Rupert history

Rupert regularly undergoes changes, and so far there have been three versions of Rupert. The first Rupert competing in Robowars autumn 2021, Señor Rupert jr and Captain Rupert competing in robowars autumn 2022 and spring 2023 and our newest Rupert in autumn 2023.

### Rupert

*Autumn 2021* - ([Branch](https://github.com/schimen/killer-robot/tree/rupert-h2021))

The first Rupert to compete. Rupert did not have any efficient weapons, but he had a very durable shell which protected him from dangerous attacks. 
Rupert fought well but with a lack of attack he could not compete with the top. Rupert came in 3rd place.

### Señor Rupert jr

*Autumn 2022* - ([Branch](https://github.com/schimen/killer-robot/tree/rupert-h2022))

The next Rupert to compete had a 600g steel cylinder with teeth which was spinning at an impressive speed. Now that Rupert was equipped with a weapon, he was able to bite back at the opponents.
Rupert fought more aggressively this time and he did very well, but the electronics could not handle the heat and ended up burning themselves up in the process. Rupert came in 2nd place.

### Captain Rupert

*Spring 2023* - ([Branch](https://github.com/schimen/killer-robot/tree/rupert-v2023))

Rupert was again equipped with the teeth, and armed with more experience.
He fought like a pirate, with everything he got, but in the final fight his weapon was destroyed and the final battle was lost. He still came in a shared 1st place.

### Rupert

*Autumn 2023* - ([Branch](https://github.com/schimen/killer-robot/tree/rupert-h2023))

This time Rupert came out of his shell with a new strategy. He brought his padlock and threw it around at the opponents.
Rupert survived surprisingly long in the arena but was sadly obliterated immediately when he met an opponent with a fast spinning weapon. Rupert came in 3rd place.
